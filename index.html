<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Computer programming</a></h1>

<p>
    Computer programming is <mark>kjkjdbjdndndbbkjggfg</mark> the process of designing <u>jhvchjvhjvch</u> and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language.

</div>

<p>
    The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace translated an article on the analytical engine by Charles Babbage.
</p>

<h2>PROGRAMMING IS EVERYWHERE</h2>

<p>
    Programming is quite literally, all around us. From the code that tells the air traffic system how to direct planes, to the algorithms that manage our healthcare data.
